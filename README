# Singly Linked List (SL_List)
## How to Compile
     ```bash
    g++ -o sl_list sl_list.cpp
    ```

This will compile the `sl_list.cpp` file and generate an executable named `sl_list`.

## How to Run

After successfully compiling the project, you can run the executable with a command file as an argument. The command file should contain the list operations you want to perform. For example:

```bash
./sl_list commands.txt
